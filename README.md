- Hi, I’m @Lazimodo
- I’m interested in becoming consciously competent in web development; at least consciously incompetent in C/C++, Python and perhaps another language. Although, I will strive hope for unconscious competence.
- I’m currently learning how to adult. Oh, and code stuffs! so there's that.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that scratches that creative technological itch.
- How to reach me...
